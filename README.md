# Time-Intervals

1. Creating a time interval for a populating image to appear after 10 seconds of time has gone by

2. When creating this project i took into consideration what i needed to complete 

3. First i needed to create my Html and connect to my Js

4. After connecting both i configured my js into two seperate parts

5. The first part to my js was creating a string a function to populate a sentence with a numerical value counting down

6. After creating this function i created a function to call to use time intervals to populate an image as soon as the numerical value hit 0

7. The end result was a time interval hitting 0 than populating an image to the user on the Html
